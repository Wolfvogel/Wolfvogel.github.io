            One evening, walking back home from a party, you decide to take a shortcut through the park to get out of the rain quicker.
            Suddenly the ground beneath you moves, and crumbles. You try to scramble to the side, but the earth gives way and you start falling and sliding down a dark hole.
            Once you've come to a halt, you wipe some of the dust out of your eyes, and fumble around in your pocket for your phone.
            As you turn on the flashlight function, you notice that your legs are quickly becoming wet.
            You look around, and see that the cave-in must have opened up access to an underground body of water.
            You find yourself in what looks like an cavern, and water is rapidly flowing in. No time to call for help!
            You see two ways out.
            To your right there is an opening covered in moss, leading down; or you could try swimming in against the stream to where the water is coming from.

        <div id="optionA" class="optionButton" onclick="optionA()">
          <p id="option01A">
            Swim in against the stream
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="optionB" class=optionButton onclick="optionB()">
          <p id="option01B">
            Climb down moss-covered opening
          </p>
        </div>
      <!--In against stream; manages, lucky she is a strong swimmer, ends up in huge cave with underwater lake that is now draining away. Wait for lake to drain out, find something on lake floor
    moss opening; slide down, game turns into rush against water-->

  function optionB(){}
    /*
    OptionA must be clickable
    OptionB must be clickable
    When option 1 is clicked, #description must change to Scenario2, optionA must change to option 2A, optionB must change to option 2B
    When option 2 is clicked, #description must change to Scenario3, optionA must change to option 3A, optionB must change to option 3B
    So, I need optionA and optionB to be divs of their own, which is clickable.
    They both hold a seperate div, which holds the specific text; this div gets its class changed based on which option is clicked,
    and which text is displayed is linked to the class of that div

    So, first I need something that makes the options clickable
    And sets a different id to description and options when either gets clicked
    Then something that inputs a different field of text in all those when they have a different id
